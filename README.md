Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a powerful tool to explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQL's: databases, tables, and columns.

It can be used in:

    Azure Application Insights
    Azure Log Analytics
    Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
    Azure Security Center
    
This is just my list of useful queries and guides for KQL
